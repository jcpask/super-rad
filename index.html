Mass Incarceration
    </h1>
    <p>
Mass incarceration is one of the biggest human rights' issues facing America today.  The biggest concerns are these: the racist structure of it, the devastation to communities, the economic exploitation that occurs, and the limitation of future options and freedoms upon release.

Some common approaches to discussing this include a halt to building new prisons, the releasing of many who are currently incarcerated, and finding alternative social solutions for those who might be arrested in the future.  For this latter option, one example is treating drug addiction as a public-health crisis, and providing needed medical attention.  This is different than how it is currently treated, which is as criminal issue.  Locking someone up will not generally not reduce their addictions, but could worsen other behavioral elements.

Prison abolition has become a trendy solution on the left, and should be pursued overall.  However, it's playing the long game--it will take much time and social change and personal change to reach a point where we no longer depend on prisons.  In the meantime, focusing on restricting the power of prosecutors, changing drug laws, and providing better support in the community for released inmates to remain in the community and not return to prison.
